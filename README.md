**# Superpixel_Segmentation**

A segmentation in superpixels consists in dividing an image into groupings of pixels, called super-pixels. These superpixels should be close enough in size and shape, stick to the object's borders, or still have consistent colors.Superpixel segmentation is generally used as an image preprocessing step for computer vision, such as pattern recognition or even visual monitoring . Working on a pixel cluster rather than pixels has many advantages. On the one hand, by simplifying the representation of an image, it makes it possible to reduce the calculation time associated with the processing of these images. Another advantage is that superpixels allow an image to be observed at a larger scale, which provides better spatial information for measuring regional characteristics.
